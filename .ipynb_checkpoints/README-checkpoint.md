# plotting_maps
The aim of this repo is to plot standardised maps of ACS climate hazard data. We will develop and provide examples of mapping climate hazards for Australia so that data can be consistently presented.
Examples will include maps for Australia and for selected states or regions. 

Intended uses include taking netcdf or xarray dataarrays of hazards and indices such as Rx1day, TXx, FFDI and plotting the data on a map of Australia.
